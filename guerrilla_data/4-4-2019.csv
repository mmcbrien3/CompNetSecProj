news@x-size.com;Pro Bodybuilders Swear By It;"    Pro Bodybuilders Swear By It!                    How do pro bodybuilders get so big?    I think we all know it takes more than good genetics, hard work and protein shakes to get super huge.    Well, two of the biggest factors in muscle growth are Testosterone and GH, in fact these two when taken together can morph a normal person into a muscular super hero.      Pro bodybuilders swear by stacking Testosterone and GH!     And not just bodybuilders, but many Hollywood stars who do action or super hero movies also.    In fact one Hollywood star with a long history of being big and ripped was going out the country to film a movie and got busted with a suitcase full of GH and Testosterone.    Of course what these guys are using is illegal and have some nasty side effects.    But what if you could use safe and legal natural supplements to boost you bodies' own natural Testosterone and GH production?    Even if you only got a fraction of the results that these monstrous pro bodybuilders get, it would be enough to take your workouts and gains to a whole new level and make you bigger and more ripped than ever before.    Introducing the awesome new...        Testosterone and G.H. Stack         If you're not satisfied with your current rate of muscle growth and your fat levels are too highI urge you to carefully read this important message because you're about to discover how to safely use testosterone and G.H. (the top powerful anabolic substance in the world) to quickly multiply your muscle growth and accelerate your fat loss like never before!   How much muscle you'll pack on varies, but other bodybuilders who have used this stack have gained over 20 pounds in just 4 short weeks, while simultaneously reducing their fat to below 5%!     Now let's get down to the bare bone facts about how this synergistic muscle building and fat burning combo works.          First we'll discuss the ""Testosterone Component"" of the stack            Andro 10   is actually a blend of 10 potent testosterone boosting supplements combined into one unique synergistic formula and you get what might be the top muscle building and fat burning testosterone supplement available.    Each potent serving of Andro 10 contains:      100 milligrams of Tongkat Ali (Long Jack)   100 milligrams of DHEA    30 milligrams of Zinc Sulphate   200 milligrams of Saw Palmetto   50 milligrams of Chrysin   350 milligrams of Tribulus Terrestris   100 milligrams of Avena Sativa   250 milligrams of Muira Puma   300 milligrams of Nettle Extract   30 milligrams of Betasistosterol     Though each one of these unique supplements is effective in and of itself it is believed that by combining them you create a synergistic combination where the combined effects may be increased exponentially, to support the production and release of your body's potent muscle-building substance - testosterone!    	       And now for the ""Growth Component""  of the stack            G.H. 30,000   is without question the top result producing growth supplement on the market.  This is no empty claim.  Yes, I know, everybody says this about their product, but if you hear me out, you'll understand exactly what I'm talking about.  	 The first thing you have to understand about growth isit's simply a prerequisite.  What I mean is, growth is produced first, then the liver converts it to IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1).  And IGF-1 is really what you want.  It's the Rolls Royce of muscle building substances!	So when you take a growth product, the question you should always ask yourself is, how much IGF-1 am I really getting?	And unfortunately, virtually all of the growth compounds on the market overlook some critical factors that severely limit the amount of IGF-1 they actually produce.      This Oral G.H. Spray was designed to   				naturally stimulate the   				production of G.H. and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).     			    Proprietary Growth Factor and G.H. Stimulator in a convenient Spray Delivery Sysyem. Delivering over 30,000 nanograms per serving containing: 					      Alpha GPC 	 	  GABA 	   Mucuna Pruriens (Cowhage) 15% L-Dopa 	 	  Deer Antler (Velvet) 	 	  Longjack (Eurycoma Longifolia)100:1   Ornithine Alpha Ketoglutarate 	 	  L-Glutamine FCC	    L-Arginine Alpha Ketogluterate (AAKG) 	 	  L-Valine Powder	  	  L-Isoleucine Powder 	 	  L-Tyrosine Powder 	 	  L-Glysine  	        	Now, quite obviously, by taking any one of these supplements you'd get some very impressive results.  However, when you combine the anabolic properties of all bothLook out.  And this isn't folklore, it's fact!  German research dating back to the 1940s is very conclusive about the extreme synergy of testosterone and growth (IGF-1) in relation to causing extraordinary muscle growth.  And no doubt you're aware of this synergy too, because it's the combination of these  anabolic substances that's creating the unbelievable muscularity of the top pros.  	But, unlike the pros, you won't have to resort to illegal tactics to grow like crazy and get ultra ripped thanks to   Andro 10   and   G.H. 30,000  .    If you ordered these products separately you would pay $121.90, but act now and you get them both for only $97.00!      Also to insure you get awesome results this stack includes a    FREE  Hardcore Workout Program!    	Don't wait  order this potent muscle building and fat burning stack legally available!

info@mariakillam.com;Ask Maria: Is my Travertine Backsplash Wrong with my White Kitchen?;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Dear Test,                  This is a situation I see all the time. A perfectly timeless and versatile white kitchen with a bossy, earthy backsplash.                  I'm convinced it's because most people, when designing a kitchen, make the easy mistake of thinking of the finishes as the final product. And if your kitchen finishes are the end point, well then it seems extremely important to make sure you add something 'interesting' when it comes to choosing a backsplash.                  This is why I see so many odd backsplash choices in otherwise perfectly versatile white kitchens. The backsplash is usually the last to be chosen and installed. And that is where people suddenly feel the need to make a 'unique' and 'creative' selection.                  My suggestion is to avoid thinking of the installed finishes like tile, in kitchens, bathrooms and on fireplaces, as the  final product . Instead, it's best to think in terms of creating a fresh and versatile backdrop or CANVAS FOR DECORATING.                  This is a much better goal.

So if you need to choose a colour or a neutral, you'll need HOW TO CHOOSE PAINT COLOURS, and if you need to Choose the right White, you will need WHITE IS COMPLICATED.                    It's so much more information with images than you'll ever find in a blog post and you'll get it in the RIGHT ORDER which will ensure that you'll find or correct the colour in your home.

We’ve been working really hard at the SitePoint offices – and no, we’re not just saying it because our boss also reads this newsletter – we really have been! You can check out what we’ve been up to below.     BUT… that doesn’t mean we didn’t have time to look up, laugh at and debate some cool stuff we found on the internets…    Here’s a few of the shiny internet things that caught our eye recently:     This  Reddit thread  that encapsulates the modern struggle of dining out at restaurants that are clearly too “conceptual” for us;       These excellent  programming puns turned into movie posters ; and       This excellently reported, but concerning  article from Bloomberg  that details how top executives at YouTube allowed fake news and conspiracies to run rampant for the sake of viral engagement.      We also took a moment to formally  farewell Google+ , a social media platform none of us used,  but it still seems sad to see it being dismantled.
